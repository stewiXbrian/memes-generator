## Intro

Meme Generator is an interactive, React-based web application designed to simplify content creation by generating custom memes instantly. The mission? Help users turn classic internet culture into personalized, shareable humor with just a few clicks.

The application's key features include a text input system that allows users to add custom "Top Text" and "Bottom Text" to a dynamic image preview. Once the captions are set, the "Get a new meme image" feature becomes available to cycle through popular templates. The app provides smart rendering by overlaying text—such as "One does not simply walk into Mordor"—directly onto iconic images with perfect alignment and formatting.
